// SWITCH TO LINUX AND KEEP GOING

/*
 - Terminal-based: TUI (ratatui)?
 - quick select block using digit/char keys, move using arrow keys
 - - if you want to move it yourself
 - - game should be playable and settable before solved
 - otherwise, solver runs in the background
 - - left and right keys step through solution
 - - up and down keys step through different sols
 - try to make the interfacing bit modular, might try to upload to website
 - - try getting it working with TUI and with GUI, too
